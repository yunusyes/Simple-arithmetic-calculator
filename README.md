# Simple-arithmetic-calculator


This program is a basic arithmetic calculator that allows users to perform four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user inputs the operation they want to perform along with two numbers, and the program returns the result of the calculation. It also includes error handling, ensuring that only valid numbers are accepted and preventing division by zero.
